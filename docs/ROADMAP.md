# Membrane Roadmap

# Version 6.2.0

- One API that calls multiple Backends
  - Ideas
    - <target ../> inside <if>
- Routing with if instead of switch and cbr
- <if>...<else>

# Version 6.1.0

- Grafana Dashboard to import in examples/prometheus
  - Also provide the datasource config
  - Maybe the config can be included into the docker-compose setup
- Refactor HttpClient
  - Replace finalize with try(...)
- JWT Signer plugin
  - Signs the body if it is a JWT
  - JWT encoder

# Discussion

- K8S stuff document or delete?
- Excpetion Handling
  - throw Exception in Interceptor handle?
- Interceptor
  - init() and init(router)
    - Which one to call or both?

- For ADRs
  - Response Flow guarantee there is a response 
  - Request Flow guarantee there is a request
  - Return guarantee Response is there

- Wenn Exception/Abort passiert sofort Response mit Error setzen.
