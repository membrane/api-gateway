/**
 * @description <p>
 *              Replaces "/./" in the request URI's path by "/".
 *              </p>
 *              <p>
 *              Necessary, as old SOA model versions do not normalize URIs before requesting them. Our WSDLPublisher
 *              links to XSD Schemas using relative paths (as we want the links to work under any servlet's context
 *              root). The SOA model then combines "http://foo/material/ArticleService?wsdl" and
 *              "./ArticleService?xsd=1" to "http://foo/material/./ArticleService?xsd=1". This URI is sent to Membrane's
 *              new soapProxy which has configured a serviceProxy-path of "\Q/material/ArticleService\E.*" which does
 *              not match.
 *              </p>
