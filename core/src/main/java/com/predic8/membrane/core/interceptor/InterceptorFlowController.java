/**
 * Controls the flow of an exchange through a chain of interceptors.
 *
 * In the trivial setup, an exchange passes through two chains until it hits
 * Outcome.RETURN: The main chain owned by the Transport (containing the
 * RuleMatching, Dispatching, UserFeature and HttpClient-Interceptors) and the
 * inner chain owned by the UserFeatureInterceptor (containing any interceptor
 * configured in proxies.xml).
 *
 * The {@link HTTPClientInterceptor}, the last interceptor in the main chain,
 * always returns {@link Outcome#RETURN} or {@link Outcome#ABORT}, never
 * {@link Outcome#CONTINUE}.
 *
 * Any chain is followed using {@link Interceptor#handleRequest(Exchange)} until
 * it hits {@link Outcome#RETURN} or {@link Outcome#ABORT}. As the chain is
 * followed, every interceptor (except those with {@link Flow#REQUEST}) are
 * added to the exchange's stack.
 *
 * When {@link Outcome#RETURN} is hit, the exchange's interceptor stack is
 * unwound and {@link Interceptor#handleResponse(Exchange)} is called for every
 * interceptor on it.
 *
 * When {@link Outcome#ABORT} is hit, handling is aborted: An
 * {@link AbortException} is thrown. The stack is unwound calling
 * {@link Interceptor#handleAbort(Exchange)} on each interceptor on it.
