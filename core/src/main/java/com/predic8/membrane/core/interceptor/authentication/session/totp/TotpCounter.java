/**
 * Counter whose value is a deterministic function of time as described in RFC 6238
 * "TOTP: Time-Based One-Time Password Algorithm".
 *
 * <p>The 64-bit counter assumes the value {@code 0} at a predefined point in time and periodically
 * increments its value by one periodically.
 *
 * <p>The value {@code V} of the counter at time instant {@code T} is:
 * <pre>
 * V = (T - T0) / TimeStep
 * </pre>
 * where {@code T0} is the earliest time instant at which the counter assumes the value {@code 0},
 * and {@code TimeStep} is the duration of time for which the values of the counter remain constant.
 *
 * <p><em>Note: All time instants are in seconds since UNIX epoch, and all time durations are
 * in seconds.</em>
 *
 * <p><em>Note: All time instants must be non-negative.</em>
 *
 * <p>Thread-safety: Instances of this class are immutable and are thus thread-safe.
