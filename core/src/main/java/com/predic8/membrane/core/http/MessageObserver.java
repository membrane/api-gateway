 * {@link ExchangeStoreInterceptor}, whose primary purpose is to write the
 * message's body into permanent storage. As this requires reading the body,
 * directly "streaming" the body from the HTTP client to the HTTP server (as
 * described in {@link AbstractBody}) would not be possible. Instead,
 * {@link ExchangeStoreInterceptor} registers a {@link MessageObserver} on the
 * message. This {@link MessageObserver} will be called back once streaming has
 * been completed and the messages' body is fully known. The
 * {@link MessageObserver} will the write the body into permanent storage.
