/**
 * A {@link MessageObserver} may be registered on a HTTP {@link Message} and

 * <p>
 * A typical example of an interceptor using {@link MessageObserver} is the
 * {@link ExchangeStoreInterceptor}, whose primary purpose is to write the
 * message's body into permanent storage. As this requires reading the body,
 * directly "streaming" the body from the HTTP client to the HTTP server (as
 * described in {@link AbstractBody}) would not be possible. Instead,
 * {@link ExchangeStoreInterceptor} registers a {@link MessageObserver} on the
 * message. This {@link MessageObserver} will be called back once streaming has
 * been completed and the messages' body is fully known. The
 * {@link MessageObserver} will then write the body into permanent storage.
