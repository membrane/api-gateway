<!--
	Routing Configuration
	
	Here you can configure routing rules for Membrane Service Proxy. It
	contains some rules to show how to setup routing. Please make sure to
	remove these rules before you put the router into production. More sample
	configurations you can find in the examples directory.

	Have a look at
	http://membrane-soa.org/service-proxy-doc/current/configuration/proxy-configuration.htm for
	documentation and a reference explaining what XML elements can be used
	how and where.
	
	See the proxies.xml files in the /examples/* directories in the Service Proxy
	distribution for several examples of how to configure different Service Proxy
	features within this file.
	
	Changes to this file will be picked up almost instantly if Membrane is
	running	once this file has been saved. Any dynamic configuration changes
	made (for example, via the adminConsole) will be forgotten.
