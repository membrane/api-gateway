# Membrane Tutorial: Message Flow
#
# API Gateways gain their flexibility through plugins. Each plugin performs its function
# at a specific point in the request or response flow.
#
# 1.) Start Membrane:
#
#     membrane.sh -c 20-Message-Flow.yaml
#
# 2.) Call the API:
#
#     curl localhost:2000
#
#    Watch the console output. The message is printed twice: once during the
#    request and once during the response flow. A valid status code appears
#    only in the second log message after the backend has responded.

api:
  port: 2000
  flow:
    # executed during the request and response flow
    - log:
        message: Path ${path} Status ${statusCode}
  target:
    url: https://api.predic8.de
