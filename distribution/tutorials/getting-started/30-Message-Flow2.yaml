# Membrane Tutorial: Message Flow 2
#
# A plugin is executed at a specific point in the request or response flow.
# By placing a plugin in either the request or the response flow, you get
# fine-grained control over its execution.
#
# 1.) Start Membrane:
#
#     membrane.sh -c 30-Message-Flow2.yaml
#
# 2.) Call the API:
#
#     curl localhost:2000
#
#     Observe in which order the numbers 1 to 6 appear in the console.
#
# 3.) Admin Console
#
#     Open in your browser: http://localhost:9000
#
#     Click on the API 'Message Flow Logging' and view the diagram
