# Membrane Tutorial: Logging
#
# Logging is a helpful tool during API development, debugging and operation.
# The log feature is a plugin that you enable in the message flow. For each call,
# the plugin logs once for the request and once for the response.
#
# 1.) Start Membrane:
#
#     Linux/Mac:
#       membrane.sh -c 10-Logging.yaml
#     Windows:
#       membrane.cmd -c 10-Logging.yaml
#
# 2.) Call the API:
#
#       curl http://localhost:2000
#
#     Check the console output to see the logged request and response details.
#
# See also:
#  - example/logging folder for additional logging configurations and access logs

spec:
  port: 2000
  flow:
    - log: {} # Logs method, path, status code, headers and body from request and response
