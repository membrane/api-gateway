# Logging Requests and Responses into a JDBC Database

Membrane can log metadata about service invocations to any database that can be accessed via JDBC.
    

## Running the Example

In this example we will configure Membrane to log to the Apache Derby database. 

To run the example execute the following steps:

1. First we need a JDBC compliant database. For this example we choose Apache Derby.

2. Download the latest Derby distribution from the following URL:  http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html

3. Extract the zip file and copy the `DERBY_HOME/lib/derbyclient.jar` into the `MEMBRANE_HOME/lib` directory.

4. Go to the `examples/logging-jdbc` directory.

5. Start the network server using the following command:    
```
    start DERBY_HOME/bin/startNetworkServer.bat
```
6. Execute `service-proxy.ps1` or `service-proxy.sh`

7. Open the URL http://localhost:2000/ in your browser.

8. Start the ij program to query the database: `DERBY_HOME/bin/ij.bat`

9. Connect to the database using the following command:
```
connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/membranedb';
```
10. Execute the following SQL query:
```
select * from membrane.statistic;
```
