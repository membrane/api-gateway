### CUSTOM WEBSOCKET INTERCEPTORS


Please visit https://www.membrane-soa.org/service-proxy-doc/current/websockets/create-websocket-interceptor.htm to learn how to create custom WebSocket interceptors.

In this folder you will find two sub-folders. Both show different ways how you can add your own WebSocket interceptor to Membrane.

The embedded example creates an embedded Membrane instance and adds the custom WebSocket interceptor.

The standalone example compiles the custom WebSocket interceptor and integrates it into a standalone Membrane application.
