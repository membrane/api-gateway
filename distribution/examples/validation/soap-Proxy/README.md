### SOAP Message Validation

To run this example execute the following steps

#### PREREQUISITES:

- Install Curl from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html , if you have not done so already. Let us assume it is in your PATH.

As the URL of a WSDL is specified in proxies.xml, the Service Proxy retrieves all corresponding schemas and tries to validate the message body using them.

As a SOAP-Proxy is a specialized version of `the ServiceProxy`, a SOAP-Proxy has a certain advantage if it is used for a SOAP Service. A SOAP-Proxy needs the WSDL's URL just once. Adding a Validator then needs less code, as you can see in the example below:

```
<soapProxy port="2000" wsdl="http://www.thomas-bayer.com/axis2/services/BLZService?wsdl">
	<validator />
</soapProxy>
```

Execute the following steps:

1. Go to `examples/validation/soap-Proxy`

2. Start `service-proxy.bat` or `service-proxy.sh`

3. Navigate into the `soap-Proxy` folder and run the following command on the console. Observe a successful response.

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/soap+xml" -d @blz-soap.xml http://localhost:2000/axis2/services/BLZService/getBankResponse
```
4. Run the following command in the same directory and observe that verification fails.
```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/soap+xml" -d @invalid-blz-soap.xml http://localhost:2000/axis2/services/BLZService/getBankResponse
```
