### LOAD BALANCING WITH STICKY SESSIONS

The `LoadBalancerInterceptor` can be configured to look for session ids in requests and responses. When the `LoadBalancerInterceptor` finds a new session id, the balancer will associate the session with the node that has received or send the message. If the session id is detected again in another message the message will be forwarded to the associated node.
 
 
#### RUNNING THE EXAMPLE

In this example we will set up a load balancer, two nodes and one client. The communication between the node and client will be session based. The client will send eleven requests. With the first request the client gets a session id that will be used for the following 10 requests. 

To run the example execute the following steps:

0. Setup
   Download the Apache Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi and unpack it. Let's
   say to C:\work\apache-maven-3.8.6 . Let us also say your Java installation resides in `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.2`. 

   Execute the following commands:
   ```
     set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.2
     set PATH=%PATH%;C:\work\apache-maven-3.8.6\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.2\bin
    ```
2. Go to the `examples/loadbalancer-session-3` directory.

3. Execute

   `service-proxy.ps1`

   This will initialize the `LoadBalancingInterceptor` and associate it with a rule.

4. Now start two nodes:
```
   mvn package
   start mvn exec:java@node1
   start mvn exec:java@node2
```
4. Open the URL http://localhost:9000/admin/

5. Click on the "Load Balancing" tab. Click on "Default", and on the next page again on "Default".

6. Nodes are identified by host name and port. Fill in the formular with "localhost" as host and 4000 as port and press "Add Node".

7. Add another node with host name "localhost" and port 4001.

8. Go to the command line and run the following command:
```
   start mvn exec:java@client
```
9. Take a look at the console output of node 1 and node 2. You will notice that only node 1 received requests, because of the session id. Membrane sends messages with the same session id to the same node.  

10. Run the client again, and you will notice that this time all requests are sent to node 2.
