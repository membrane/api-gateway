# Where can I find proxies.xml samples?

Membrane is moving from XML-based configuration to YAML-based configuration. However, Membrane still
supports the XML-based configuration with 'proxies.xml' files. Some examples in the subfolders are
using the YAML and some are using the XML configuration.

You can find the 'proxies.xml' files at the github repository:
