# Where can I find proxies.xml samples?

Membrane is moving from XML based configuration to YAML based configuration. However, Membrane still 
supports the XML based configuration with 'proxies.xml' files. Some examples in the subfolders are 
using the YAML and some are using the XML configuration.

You can sill find 'proxies.xml' files for the samples at github:
