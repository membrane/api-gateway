**NOTICE: THIS IS A DRAFT**

### Service Discovery With Etcd

The publisher publishes endpoint details for services to "the cloud". The configurator reads those details from "the cloud" and dynamically forwards to those services
 

#### RUNNING THE EXAMPLE

In this example we will start a self-publishing service that responds with "hello" that can be called from another service without knowledge of the endpoint

1. Download etcd: go to "https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/", scroll down to the "Downloads" section and pick the version for your operating system
   
2. Extract etcd in any directory and start etcd
   
3. In the membrane folder go to `examples/service-discovery-with-etcd/`
   
4. Execute `configurator/start.bat`
   
5. Open your favorite browser and go to `localhost:9001`, this opens the admin console of the configurator
   
6. Notice that "Console" is the only available service, "Console" is the admin console
   
7. Execute the `publisher/start.bat`
   
8. Open another tab in your browser and go to `localhost:8081/myService` and receive "hello" as response, this is a service from the publisher
   
9. Go back to the admin console window and refresh the page, another service should appear
   
10. Open another tab in your browser and go to `localhost:8080/myService` and receive `hello` as response, this is a service from the configurator
    
11. Exit the `publisher.bat` and wait 20 seconds.
    
12. Go back to the admin console window and refresh the page, the second service should disappear


#### HOW IT IS DONE

This section describes the example in detail.  

First take a look at the `proxies.xml` file in the publisher folder.

```

<etcdPublisher baseUrl="http://localhost:4001" baseKey="/example" ttl="20"/>
	<router>
		<serviceProxy name="helloResponse" port="8081">
			<path>/myService</path>
			<groovy>				
			exc.response = Response.ok("Hello").build()
			RETURN
			</groovy>
		</serviceProxy>
	</router>
```
You will see that there is a service proxy that responds with `hello` when going to http://localhost:8081 in you browser. On top of that you can see the `<etcdPublisher>` that is responsible for publishing the endpoint details to an etcd.

The `<etcdPublisher>` element has 3 values that you can set and by default it is set to publish to a locally started etcd on "http://localhost:4001" every 5 minutes.   
* `baseUrl` is the url the etcd is residing on
* `baseKey` is the directory where the endpoint details are saved
* `ttl` is how long in seconds the data in the etcd should be valid

Now take a look at the `proxies.xml` file in the configurator folder.

```
<etcdBasedConfigurator baseUrl="http://localhost:4001" baseKey="/example" port="8080"/>
	<router>
	<transport/>
		<serviceProxy name="Console" port="9001">
			<adminConsole />
		</serviceProxy>
	</router>
```
You will see a service proxy that provides the admin console on port `9001`. Additionally, on top you can see the etcdBasedConfigurator that reads from an etcd and creates service proxies for those services dynamically.
The `etcdBasedConfigurator` has 3 values that you can set and by default it is set to read from an etcd on http://localhost:4001 and provides its service on port `8080`.

* `baseUrl` is the url the etcd is residing on
* `baseKey` is the directory where the call details are saved
* `port` is the port the `etcdBasedConfigurator` provides its service on
