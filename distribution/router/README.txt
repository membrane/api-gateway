Starting Membrane
==================

Make sure Java 21 or higher is installed. Then open a terminal and execute in this folder:

* On Linux:
  ./membrane.sh

* On Windows:
  ./membrane.cmd

By default, the gateway uses the apis.yaml file in the conf folder as configuration.

If you want to use a different configuration file or to use the old XML configuration, use the -c option:

./membrane.sh -c conf/proxies.xml
